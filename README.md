- **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data, identifying key patterns, and cleaning the dataset.
- **Task 2: Lookalike Identification**: Building a predictive model to identify similar customers based on features from the `Customers.csv` and `Transactions.csv` datasets.
- **Task 3: Customer Segmentation/Clustering**: Performing customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on transaction data and customer profiles.
